# OntoSeed

Build a scale-independent "seed ontology" with four universal rules: identity, containment, cause, reflection. Provide SHACL validation so every new concept is auto-checked.

## Overview

OntoSeed is a Next.js 15 application that implements a foundational ontology system with built-in validation and zero-knowledge proof capabilities.

## Features

- **SHACL Validation**: Interactive playground for testing ontology concepts
- **Semantic Communication**: Bandwidth-efficient encoding/decoding
- **ZKP Provenance**: Zero-knowledge proof system for trust and verification
- **Four Universal Rules**: Identity, Containment, Cause, and Reflection

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install pyshacl for validation
pip install pyshacl

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
